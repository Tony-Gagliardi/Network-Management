1.) OSPF -- Describes the OSPF routing protocol

	perfHistTCMIB -- Provides 15 minute based performance history counts using Textual Conventions.

	natMIB -- Defines generic objects for Network Address Translation

	dlsw -- defines objects for management of Data Link Switches

2.) netman@netman:~$ snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: R1.mycompany.com

	The 'snmpget' command uses the SNMP GET request to query for additional information on a network entitiy. The '-c public' part of the command sets the community to public. The '-v 1' part of the command specifies protocol version 1. So, this command will retrieve the variable/OID '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0' from the host '172.20.74.100' using protocol 'version 1' and the community string 'public'. The specified OID is the object 'sysName', so it's querying the sysName of port 0. 

3.) snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
Failed object: SNMPv2-MIB::sysName

	The above command fails because there is no variable/OID '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5' on '172.20.74.100'. This happened because the '.0' was dropped from the command in problem 2, so it's just calling the sysName object and not specifying a port, which is necessary for the query to work.

4.) 'snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0' ; where '.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1' is the OID for ifNumber.
	
	IF-MIB::ifNumber.0 = INTEGER: 5
	So, there are 5 interfaces on this system.
